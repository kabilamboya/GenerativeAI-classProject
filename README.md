## 🚀 Project Overview

Entrepreneurs often struggle with branding in early stages. This system demonstrates how generative AI can:

1. Generate brand names based on business ideas
2. Create slogans and mission statements
3. Suggest design placement (front, back, sleeve)
4. Instantly visualize the branding on a 3D apparel model

The result is an interactive tool that merges creativity, AI, and visualization.
